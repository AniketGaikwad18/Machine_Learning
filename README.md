Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository!
This is where I document my learning journey in Data Science & ML through code, experiments, and small projects. The repo contains well-structured notebooks and scripts covering fundamental to intermediate concepts.

📂 What’s Inside?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing and understanding data through bivariate and multivariate analysis (Titanic, Tips, Iris, Flights datasets).

Feature Encoding
Implementations of Ordinal Encoding & Label Encoding on the Marketing Campaign dataset.

ML Pipelines
Using scikit-learn Pipelines to train, save, and load models for predictions (e.g., Titanic survival prediction with pipe.pkl).

(More projects to be added as I continue learning 🚧)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 🐍

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

🎯 Why this repo?

To track and share my progress in ML 📈

To create a reference hub for fundamental ML concepts 🧑‍💻
